Description: Functional annotation of large multidomain proteins by
    iterative HH-suite-based procedure. The procedure utilizes fragments
    of a large multidomain protein sequence as queries to profile
    databases. It allows to avoid underestimation of statistical support
    that is often observed when standard tools are used to annotate large
    multidomain proteins.
